Runtime Files
─────────────
This software requires a number of third-party runtime files which are provided within the installation.
The copyright of these files belongs to the respective owners, and as such,
they are outside the scope of the GNU General Public License.

Compiling the Software
──────────────────────
It is possible to compile the software yourself.
You will need to install the QT development SDK, and build the software from the command line using the Asteroid.pro file.

On successful compilation, the application binary will be written to the ‟bin directory” that you specified -
which is the top-level directory, by default.
In order to run it from there,
you will need to copy the *.wav files shipped with the installation into the ‟media” sub-directory of the bin directory.
For Windows:
∙	the application depends on QT and Microsoft runtime DLLs,
	which should be in the place appropriate for run-time DLL's on your system,
	or else (by default) in the application directory.

Addendum (2021/06/22)
─────────────────────
This is an application made on QT, which has a 2-tier building process that involves first generating a Makefile from a *.pro file.
A sample Make.sh script has been included, containing this command:
	/usr/lib64/qt4/bin/qmake -makefile Asteroid.pro
that shows how this is done for our specific configuration.
It would have to be modified to suit your system.

The libraries installed on our system, for this, include the following:
	phonon-qt4-backend-gstreamer.x86_64
	phonon-qt4-devel.x86_64
	phonon-qt4.x86_64
	qt-devel.x86_64
	qt.x86_64
You will need the same libaries, or those compatible with them, as well as any libraries that they depend on.
Other than to note this, we can provide no further help or guidance.

Addendum (2021/09/11)
─────────────────────
In contrast to the original versions of Asteroid Cresta, which were geared mainly toward Windows,
testing and development have been done, here, on and primarily for Linux platforms.

The DLL's and other Windows-specific files, provided originally with Asteroid Cresta,
have been moved to a separate subdirectory, ‟Windows”.
They may be later used, on our systems, and brought back into active use for testing and developing for Windows platforms, as well;
but are not all up to date with respect to the current version of QT and may need to be revised.
