RUNTIME FILES
This software requires a number of third-party runtime files which are provided
within the installation. The copyright of these files belongs to the respective
owners, and as such, they are outside the scope of the GNU General Public License.

COMPILING THE SOFTWARE
It is possible to compile the software yourself. You will need to install the QT
development SDK, and build the software from the command line using the
asteroid.pro file.

On successful compilation, the application binary will be written to the "source/bin"
directory. In order to run it from there, you will need to copy the *.wav files
shipped with the installation into the "source/bin/media" directory. You should
also note that the application depends on a number of QT and Microsoft runtime
DLLs which should either be in the application directory, or in an appropriate
location on your system.
