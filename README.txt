Runtime Files
─────────────
This software requires a number of third-party runtime files which are provided within the installation.
The copyright of these files belongs to the respective owners, and as such,
they are outside the scope of the GNU General Public License.

Compiling the Software
──────────────────────
It is possible to compile the software yourself.
You will need to install the QT development SDK, and build the software from the command line using the asteroid.pro file.

On successful compilation, the application binary will be written to the ‟source/bin” directory.
In order to run it from there,
you will need to copy the *.wav files shipped with the installation into the ‟source/bin/media” directory.

For Windows:
∙	You should also note that the application depends on a number of QT and Microsoft runtime DLLs
	which should either be in the application directory, or in an appropriate location on your system.

Addendum (2021/06/22)
─────────────────────
In contrast to the original versions of Asteroid Cresta, which were geared mainly toward Windows,
testing and development have been done, here, on and primarily for Linux platforms.

This is an application made on QT, which has a 2-tier building process that involves first generating a Makefile from a *.pro file.
For our configuration, a makefile was generated with the command:
        /usr/lib64/qt4/bin/qmake -makefile Asteroid.pro
It would have to be modified to suit your system.

The libraries installed on our system, for this, include the following:
        phonon-qt4-backend-gstreamer.x86_64
        phonon-qt4-devel.x86_64
        phonon-qt4.x86_64
        qt-devel.x86_64
        qt.x86_64
You will need the same libaries, or those compatible with them, as well as any libraries that they depend on.
Other than to note this, we can provide no further help or guidance.
