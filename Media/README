For now, the two sets of media files
∙	Version 1.8 (the files originally distributed):
	Intro0.mp3,
	Play0.mp3
and
∙	Version 1.9 (the files)
	Intro1.mp3 (modified by Darth Ninja in 2015, Darth Spectra's voice added in 2020)
	Play1.mp3 (modified by Darth Ninja in 2016, refinements by Darth Spectra in 2020)
are selected between using symbolic links; which are current set as:
	Intro.mp3 → Intro1.mp3
	Play.mp3 → Play1.mp3

A more ideal arrangement would be to set up the following items in a Makefile:

## System link command:
#LN=cp
LN=ln -sf

## Media Version:
#MV=0
MV=1
Intro.mp3: Intro$(MV).mp3
	$(LN) Intro$(MV).mp3 Intro.mp3
Play.mp3: Play$(MV).mp3
	$(LN) Play$(MV).mp3 Play.mp3

However, this will require either
∙	modifying the top-level Asteroid.pro QT makefile somehow invoke a call to a Makefile in this subdirectory,
or
∙	creating a new top-level Makefile that will
	―	invoke qmake on Asteroid.pro to generate the previous top level Makefile,
	and
	―	also invoke the Makefile in this subdirectory.
or otherwise
∙	to add run-time media selection to the menu or as a start-up configuration option.

The decision between these alternatives, or other alternatives as-yet-unseen, will be reserved for a later revision.
